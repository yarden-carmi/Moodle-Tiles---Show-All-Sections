Privacy Policy for "Moodle Tiles - Show All Sections" Chrome Extension

Last Updated: May 15, 2025

Thank you for using the "Moodle Tiles - Show All Sections" Chrome Extension (hereinafter referred to as the "Extension"). This privacy policy outlines how the Extension handles information.

1. No Data Collection or Storage

The Extension is designed to enhance your Browse experience on Moodle course pages using the "Tiles" format. It operates entirely within your local browser.

We do not collect, store, use, or share any of your personal information.
The Extension does not track your Browse activity.
The Extension does not require you to create an account or provide any personal data to use it.
All operations performed by the Extension are done locally on your computer and affect only the Moodle web page currently active in your browser tab when you invoke the extension.
2. How the Extension Works

The Extension functions by injecting a client-side JavaScript into the Moodle web page you are currently viewing. This script interacts with the page's Document Object Model (DOM) to:
* Identify clickable "tile" elements representing course sections.
* Programmatically simulate clicks on these tiles to trigger the Moodle page's own mechanism for loading section content.
* Modify the display style of these sections to make them all visible simultaneously.

This process is contained within your browser and the active Moodle tab. No information about your Moodle account, your course content (other than manipulating its display locally), or your interactions is transmitted to us or any third party.

3. Permissions

The Extension requests the following permissions in Google Chrome, with justifications provided during the Chrome Web Store submission process:

activeTab: To allow the extension to run when you click its icon on the Moodle page you are viewing.
scripting: To inject the necessary JavaScript into the Moodle page to modify its appearance as described above.
host_permissions (e.g., *://yourmoodlesite.example.com/*): To ensure the extension can operate on the intended Moodle website(s).
These permissions are used solely for the core functionality of modifying the display of the Moodle course page locally in your browser and do not facilitate any data collection or transmission.

4. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by an updated "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically. Your continued use of the Extension after any changes signifies your acceptance of these changes. Â
